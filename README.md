# Overview

This repo contains C++ software that performs aviation Weight and Balance calculations. 

I made this software so pilots can easily determine whether their aircraft will be within operating limitations during their upcoming flight.

# Development Environment

CLion

C++
- Libraries: JSON for Modern C++ (Niels Lohmann)

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

- Add additional Aircraft profiles (JSON files in aircraft directory)
- - Add menu to select different Aircraft profiles or insert new profiles
- Make UI to so user doesn't have to interact with terminal
- Display CG calculations in within the limitation "envelope"
- Performance Calculations based on current weather observations
